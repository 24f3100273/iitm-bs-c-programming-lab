- (Optional) Setup Codespace with local VS code: [Code spaces with visual studio code](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code)


## Getting used to the VS code interface in CodeSpaces

The Github CodeSpaces is like a virtual machine running on the cloud which you can access using a web browser. It is a linux system which is running on the cloud. 

Here you have:
- The Explorer (**Ctrl+Shift+E**)- where your can see your files. 
- The Terminal (**Ctrl+`**)- where your can run your commands like compiling and running the code.
- The Source control (**Ctrl+Shift+G**)- where your can commit and push your changes. (In simple terms it is like saving your version of the code)
- The Editor - where you can view and edit the contents of your files.

### Explorer

You can find the Explorer in the top left corner of the codespace or use the shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+E**.

Try the following:
- Create a new flie
- Create a new folder
- Delete the newly created files and folder.
