## Smart Lighting System Configuration

You are designing a smart lighting system for a 16-room building. Each room's light can either be ON or OFF. Initially, all lights in the building are OFF. Perform the following operations step by step to configure the lighting system by printing print state of the lights in each step:

1. Enter any room number of your choice (1 ≤ n ≤ 16). Upon entering a room, toggle the light in that room and in every nth room after it. (For example, if you enter Room 3, toggle the lights in Room 3, Room 6, Room 9, Room 12, and Room 15).
2. After toggling, turn ON the lights in given room numbers to prepare for maintenance.
3. Turn OFF the lights in given room numbers  to save energy in unused rooms.
4. Simulate a power-saving mode by applying an alternate lighting pattern across all rooms. The pattern alternates lights ON and OFF, starting with Room 1.
5. Print how many lights remain on in the building at the end of the process.
